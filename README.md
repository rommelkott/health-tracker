# Health Tracker
This app allows users to track and share their weight loss and fitness progress with others. Just a project to get back into the groove of programming & to upgrade my personal site.

Site was boostrapped with T3, plan to try this again with astro for fun.

## Features

Here are some of the features we plan to include in the webapp:

- User authentication to securely log in and access personal account information
- User profile editing to update details such as name, weight, exercise, etc
- A user-friendly interface built with tailwind for easy navigation
- An API to enable integration with external scripts and apps
- Downloadable Apple shortcuts that allow for automation with iPhones

## Todo

Here is our current to-do list for the Weight Tracker webapp:

- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Allow for editing of account details
- [ ] Build API to enable integration with external scripts
- [ ] Create downloadable shortcuts for desktop and mobile devices
